Bengali calendar , usually either in the October or
end September in English calendar. But this time it is
something different. As per Bengali almanac the month
Aswin is denoted as an inauspicious month(malmas)
when any sort of auspicious work is prohibited. In the
dawns of Mahalayas the Bengalees are used to listen
to Mahisasuramardini- the programme welcoming
Durgapuja with the note Aswiner Sarada prate beje
uthechhe alokmanjari (Puja mornings in Aswin month
tinkle with luminosity )in the voice of Birendra Krishna
Bhadra broadcast from All India Radio station. With
Mahalaya the counting of puja days start though there is
no scriptural link to it. However, some contraventions
are found at times. In 1982 same thing happened, puja
came late by more than a month after Mahalaya. In
fact , one can get the scent of Durgapuja from the sky,
from the air of Bengal and feel that the Durga puja is
approaching. The natural surroundings get remarkably
changed. The air carrying the fragrance of Siuli flower,
the sky having the floating bunch of ethereal cloud
and the catkins in villages inform that puja is coming.
Something is wrong but this time, that atmosphere is
foiled either may be of Corona Pandemic or because
of late arrival of puja after Mahalaya. Catkins are
certainly blooming , fragfrance of siuli is around, the
natural atmosphere of autumn even in rain peeps in but
we are having mental problem to come out from last
six months’ corona spell. From that point of view the
situation is really something unprecedented.</b></p>
                                    <p class="about-pera1 mb-25"><b>History reveals that Bengal’s own festival Durgotsav
remained untarnished even in the face of various
calamities in past also but there was no compromise
with puja that was observed in a grand manner, if not
incapable at all. This time also we do hope that the
Durgotsav will be observed after following due strict
health guidelines.</b></p>
									<p class="about-pera1 mb-25"><b>Let’s turn the pages of history to review such cases in
past .
In the monthly Magazine Basumati while writing a
serial under the title Puratan Panjika (the old Almanac)
Rasaraj Amritalal Basu, the famous theatre personality,
had nicely explained the Bengalee psychology that
dictated to celebrate the festival in a grand fashion on
the occasion of Durgapuja. He labeled Durgapuja as
Bengal’s ethnic festival and elaborated some aspects in
his excellent style of narration.
Durgotsab is Bengal’s ethnic festival. This is like being
immersed during the monsoon Bengalees wipe their
entire bodies in Aswin and put on new clothes to get
engaged in the work of new life. Bengalees welcome the
Mahashakti (super power) in the name of Anandamoyee
in Aswin month and place her in the hearts of their own
families. Bengalees are not satisfied just to prostrate on
the ground imagining their parents staying afar in the
void and in formless form. Rather they like to instill
life of Mother in the idol and place her in a Mandap.
Imagining the dear daughter residing at the house of
her husband coming to her Father’s house they become
emotional out of joy.</b></p>
<div class="about-img">
                                    <img src="assets/img/dt2.JPG" alt="">
                                </div>
									<p class="about-pera1 mb-25"><b>The gist is that Mother Durga is not only Devi to
Bengalees but also daughter of the house. So she is
named Uma. Amritalal says, Bengalees never give any
importance to the obstacles in the face of puja. Obstacles
may come, still the home coming of the daughter is
always welcome, whatever may be the means. The most
important matter is she is coming back to her own . </b></p>
									<p class="about-pera1 mb-25"><b>home. In those days the storms during Sept-Oct were
very famous in Kolkata and historical evidences are
there that the public life used to be devastated because
of the storms. Naturally that affected also Durgapuja.
This time also we faced Amphan during May. Since there
is a reasonable gap with the puja month this is under
control now. But the natural calamity during Sept -Oct
month just before puja did seldom give any chance to
control the situation. There is a big and abnormal hike
in the price of everything during the puja time when
everything in general is costly. The abnormal high price
did create trouble earlier, that tradition continues till
today. But even amidst the loss and destruction because
of the storm the festive spirit of Bengalees did never get
hampered. In fact , Bengalees did not allow the note of
sorrow to destroy the mood of festivity.
This severe Aswin tempest sank down so many ships,
razed to the ground so many houses but not a single hay
of the festive hut of Bengal did move.</b></p>
									<p class="about-pera1 mb-25"><b>The situation is not much changed now in comparison
to the situation of the society then.The high price during
puja time makes life miserable even today. Shri Amritlal
gave an account how the situation made people enjoying
the puja celebration troublesome due to natural calamity
and exactly at what ratio was the price hike.
After three years in the month of Kartick since the
storm came in the night it killed many people of Calcutta
though it was not that much severe in the month of
Aswin. On the one hand it was for puja marketing time
and on the other hand the outbreak of storm, the prices
of all the goods rose up high. You will be surprised
hearing that the cost of good quality Balam rice was
more than Rs. 3/ per maund. The full grown Ruhi fish
cost 6 annas even7 annas thus the hike in price was
such that people suffered a lot. Families with 8 to10
members having earning of Rs.40/per month while
managed earlier even to afford another 2 people staying
at their places for 2/3 days were put in trouble. Only
the hut -builders, masons, labourers, and the owners of
ships carrying cargos were benefitted. The ships costing
Rs 2/or Rs 3/ per day rose to Rs80-90 and not dropped
under Rs.40-60 till one year.</b></p>
									<p class="about-pera1 mb-25"><b>Still people could take the abnormal expenses as
something usual and used to arrange for celebration
of puja at their level best. Though the time is changed
today but the habit of Bengalees is, I doubt, not changed.
However, there is a basic and qualitative difference
between the association of people in Durgapuja in those . days and today. The impact of Baro Yari Puja was not
then that much as it is today.
In 1909 Sanatan Dharmarakshini Sava started first
Baro yari Puja in Bhawanipore at Kolkata and post 25
years this Baro Yari Puja was not
in popular practice. But today
the scenario is different where
the basic fear is more chances
of more people getting infected
by corona virus due to puja
gathering resulting ultimately
to uncontrollable wide spread of
the disease. In earlier days there
was no pomp and grandeur in
Baro Yari Puja so there was no
fear of spreading any contagious
disease centering puja. There
was restriction in entry for
public at the pujas of aristocratic
houses. So there was no link
between puja and epidemic. At
least this is certain that then the
administration did least bother.
The scenario of villages used to
be something different. Pujas in
the houses became the meeting
place to enjoy the festivity. As a result, when in 1918
Spanish Flu after Mumbai did affect Kolkata people that
lasted till 1920 ,the puja in October month at Kolkata
continued without a break inspite of the sudden violent
outbreak of the flu in the month of October1919. The
Baro Yari pujas of Kolkata were not concomitant to
it. No doubt, there was some effect on in house pujas
but no historical record of discontinuation of puja is
found. We have idea about plague at local levels. We
have the history of death of countless people that almost
depopulated Boral village in south 24 parganas in 1867
due to malaria. Rajnarayan Basu depicted the picture
in his ‘Gramya Upakhyan’ , but he wrote nothing on
its effect on Durgapuja . During that time the well off
people of Boral village shifted to some other places.
We can assume that Durgapujas of those families were
discontinued, but no historical evidence is available
to that effect. There are instances of bleakness in the
villages due to cholera , that affected puja also, still
people somehow could ultimately manage to overcome
those fleeting disasters. Shri Tulsidas Basu of the Basu
family , first inhabitant of Boral village came again to
live with his family and the puja that started, has been
continuing thenceforth till today. We are not getting
any data, any record, any evidence, any instance even orally that Durgapuja was totally stopped at any place
only because of plague or epidemic. It might have so
happened that pujas were stopped in a particular area
for a certain time in some villages or Muffasils.</b></p>
<div class="about-img">

                                </div>
									<p class="about-pera1 mb-25"><b>Though,in Calcutta the fact was
something different in times of
Spanish Flu. Calcutta Durga Pujas
, controlled by the aristocratic
houses of wealthy people used to
showcase the standard of their
prosperity at that time.
Recently Rwiju Basu has written
an article in Ananda Bazar Patrika
describing the new norms will
be followed like use of mask and
sanitization by the organizers of
200years age old Durga pujas.
People were not so much health
conscious 100 years before. The
rules by doctors were also not so
strict. During the spread of Spanish
Flu and even before that there was
no Baro Yari Puja as such, hence
the question of infecting others
during puja did not arise. But now,
the aristocratic houses, organising Durga Pujas are
planning to control the entries of the outsiders .They
did take same step in similar situation 100 years before,
revealed the family members of some houses though no
written document is available exactly what steps were
taken.
According to Amritalal Basu ,Bengalees are keen to
make preparation for Durgapuja , come what may and
the history of our Baro Yari Puja confirms this fact. The
pujas in Bengalee houses might have been stopped due
to financial crisis or some other reason but there is no
evidence of discontinuation of puja as a whole due to
plague or natural calamity . The example of Baro yari
puja is drawn here as because the participation of public
is much more in such pujas due to comprehensible
reason . In the Corona atmosphere the relevance of this
context is beyond question. There are evidences that
during second world war public participated in pujas
ignoring extreme obstructions and not only that , at
that time seven new pujas were started in Calcutta
which earned good reputation with the time .
Firstly ,Badamtala Ashar Sangha-this puja was started
in 1939 by the local people. For last four decades the
organizers of this puja have been engaged to present creative speciality in terms of the idol and the theme
pandal.
Secondly, the Ahiritola Sarbojonin Durgotsav, one of
the oldest Baro yari pujas near the shore of Ganges in
north Calcutta. This puja was also initiated by the local
people.
Thirdly, Mata Amba (another form of Devi Durga)
used to be worshipped in every Navaratri at Chaltabagan,
Lohapatty in North Calcutta which was transformed to
Durga puja in 1942 onwards and became famous.
Fourthly ,puja of Ekdalia Evergreen was started in
1943 by the people of Gariahat at south Calcutta and
has been still maintaining the traditional form amidst
the theme pujas by the committee members.
Fifth is the Singhee Park Puja and sixth is the
Sarbojanin Puja at Sovabajar Beniatola that was
started in1944. Halsibagan puja was started in 1945
and continues till today as an innovative well themed
puja.
We have to keep in mind that the people of Bengal
time and again fell in dire financial crisis and thereby
suffered a lot. In 1943 there was famine and people of
Bengal were compelled to spend the days by starving.
Moreover, the Calcuttans had another problem. People
had to leave the city in fear of the bombing from Japan.
Not only the problem of fooding but people were
stricken with the problem of clothing as well. Human
being has basic three needs –food, shelter and clothing,
even when these were at stake then also Bengalees never
hesitated to take preparation for Durgapuja. Professor
Barada Datta Roy, in his article Pujaye Banglar Bastra
Samasya published in Desh patrika in 1942 portrayed
clearly the clothing problem in Bengal during world war
and more clearly and nicely etched the sentiments and
emotions of Bengalees centering Puja even in the critical
times.</b></p>

Bengal taday? Where is the newly bloomed hope and
dream in the Saradiya festival? Where is that resonance
in the strings of Golden harp? Today that lotus –forest
is afflicted by communal disturbances. The altar of
worship is abandoned. The villages are as quiet as
cremation ground. Only the howling of jackals and
barking of dogs can be heard in the night times but
during day times the cackling of children, the sounds of
the bangles of quiet village maids are lost in the shriek
. The terror stricken women are fleeing , the youths are
asylum seeker, and the old people are almost dead. That
huge Hindu society of East Bengal now in tents, in
fields as unidentified, friendless, kinless can be found
at Bihar, Odissa, Madras, Mysore or in Andaman. No
one is left to light up the lamp in the land of their past
fourteen generations. No mother is awaiting her son,
no wife is awaiting her husband no one is awake till
the night in those dreamless villages. There is no one
left who can worship. Bramhins, Priests, blacksmiths,
potters, all have fled. The large society is now landless,
seeker of asylum. The penniless and robbed of middle
class are but heaving deep, weary sighs in puja days
thinking of their predecessors. We know that tears rolling in the eyes of numerous family members- Durga
, symbol of power will not be invoked. No chanting
of slokas for fame, life, prosperity, success will be
there in the Mandaps. Devi Durga, herself is seeking
shelter today. Being landless, so many families of East
Bengal have stopped celebrating puja today. They are
roaming around like the lost case with the ration card.
